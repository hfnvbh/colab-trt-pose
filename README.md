Simple demo for pose estimation with trt-pose in Google Colab. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hfnvbh/colab-trt-pose/blob/master/trt-pose.ipynb)

This project based on [NVIDIA-AI-IOT/trt_pose](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/trt_pose) project and uses its [live demo](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/trt_pose/blob/master/tasks/human_pose/live_demo.ipynb) adapted to work with youtube videos in Google Colab.
